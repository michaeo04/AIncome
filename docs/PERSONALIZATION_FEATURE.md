# Chatbot Personalization Feature

## Overview

This feature adds personalized onboarding to collect user preferences and information, enabling the AI chatbot to provide tailored financial advice and communication that matches each user's unique situation, goals, and communication style.

## Problem Statement

The generic chatbot responses were not contextually relevant to individual users' financial situations, goals, or preferred communication styles. This led to a less engaging and less helpful user experience.

## Solution

A comprehensive personalization system that collects user information during onboarding and uses it to customize chatbot responses.

## Architecture

### 1. Database Schema

**New Migrations:**
- `004_add_user_personalization.sql` - Adds personalization fields to profiles table
- `005_add_has_completed_onboarding.sql` - Adds onboarding completion tracking

**New Fields in `profiles` table:**
- `financial_goals` (JSONB) - Array of user's financial goals
- `financial_knowledge` (TEXT) - User's financial knowledge level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- `communication_style` (TEXT) - Preferred chatbot communication style
- `age_range` (TEXT) - User's age bracket
- `financial_concerns` (JSONB) - Array of primary financial concerns
- `income_level` (TEXT) - General income bracket
- `family_situation` (TEXT) - Family/living situation
- `has_completed_personalization` (BOOLEAN) - Personalization completion status
- `has_completed_onboarding` (BOOLEAN) - Overall onboarding completion status

### 2. TypeScript Types

**Location:** `src/types/index.ts`

**New Types:**
- `FinancialGoal` - Union type for financial goals
- `FinancialKnowledge` - Union type for knowledge levels
- `CommunicationStyle` - Union type for communication styles
- `AgeRange` - Union type for age ranges
- `FinancialConcern` - Union type for financial concerns
- `IncomeLevel` - Union type for income levels
- `FamilySituation` - Union type for family situations
- `UserPersonalization` - Interface combining all personalization fields

### 3. Constants & Options

**Location:** `src/constants/personalization.ts`

Defines all available options for each personalization field with:
- Value (for database storage)
- Label (for display)
- Icon (for visual representation)
- Description (where applicable)

### 4. Onboarding Flow

**New Screen:** `src/screens/onboarding/PersonalizationScreen.tsx`

**Flow Steps:**
1. **Welcome** - Introduction to personalization benefits
2. **Financial Goals** - Multi-select goals (save for house, pay debt, etc.)
3. **Financial Knowledge** - Single-select knowledge level
4. **Communication Style** - Single-select preferred style
5. **Age Range** - Single-select age bracket
6. **Financial Concerns** - Multi-select primary concerns
7. **Income Level** - Single-select income bracket
8. **Family Situation** - Single-select living situation
9. **Complete** - Confirmation and completion

**Features:**
- Progress bar showing completion percentage
- Skip option (can personalize later in Settings)
- Back navigation between steps
- Form validation
- Auto-save to database on completion

### 5. Navigation Updates

**Modified Files:**
- `src/navigation/types.ts` - Added Personalization screen type
- `src/navigation/OnboardingNavigator.tsx` - Added Personalization screen to stack
- `src/screens/onboarding/InitialSetupScreen.tsx` - Updated to navigate to Personalization instead of completing onboarding

**New Flow:**
```
OnboardingScreen → InitialSetupScreen → PersonalizationScreen → Main App
```

### 6. AI Service Integration

**Modified File:** `src/services/aiService.ts`

**Changes:**
- `chatWithGemini()` function now accepts optional `UserPersonalization` parameter
- Personalization data is passed to the Supabase Edge Function `chat-gemini`
- Edge Function can use this data to customize responses

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { chatWithGemini } from '../services/aiService';

const response = await chatWithGemini(
  userMessage,
  conversationHistory,
  userPersonalization // Optional
);
```

## Implementation Details

### Data Storage

Personalization data is stored in the `profiles` table as a mix of JSONB arrays (for multi-select fields) and TEXT (for single-select fields). This approach provides:
- Flexibility for multi-select options
- Type safety with CHECK constraints
- Easy querying and filtering
- Simple schema evolution

### Validation

- Multi-select fields require at least one selection
- Single-select fields are required (except when skipping)
- All data is validated on the client side before submission
- Database constraints ensure data integrity

### User Experience

- **Optional but Encouraged** - Users can skip personalization
- **Clear Benefits** - Welcome screen explains the benefits
- **Visual Progress** - Progress bar shows completion
- **Easy Navigation** - Back button for corrections
- **Fast Completion** - Takes approximately 2 minutes

## Edge Function Integration

The chatbot Edge Function (`chat-gemini`) should be updated to:

1. **Receive personalization data** in the request body
2. **Build context** based on user preferences
3. **Adjust tone** according to communication style
4. **Provide relevant advice** based on goals and concerns
5. **Match complexity** to knowledge level

### Example Edge Function Usage

```typescript
// In the Edge Function
const { message, conversationHistory, userPersonalization } = await req.json();

let systemPrompt = "You are a helpful financial assistant.";

if (userPersonalization) {
  // Adjust based on communication style
  if (userPersonalization.communication_style === 'casual') {
    systemPrompt += " Use a friendly, conversational tone.";
  } else if (userPersonalization.communication_style === 'professional') {
    systemPrompt += " Use a formal, professional tone.";
  }

  // Add context for financial knowledge
  if (userPersonalization.financial_knowledge === 'beginner') {
    systemPrompt += " Explain financial concepts in simple terms.";
  }

  // Include relevant goals
  if (userPersonalization.financial_goals?.length > 0) {
    systemPrompt += ` The user's financial goals include: ${userPersonalization.financial_goals.join(', ')}.`;
  }

  // Add context for concerns
  if (userPersonalization.financial_concerns?.length > 0) {
    systemPrompt += ` They are particularly concerned about: ${userPersonalization.financial_concerns.join(', ')}.`;
  }

  // Family context
  if (userPersonalization.family_situation) {
    systemPrompt += ` They are ${userPersonalization.family_situation}.`;
  }
}
```

2. Run `005_add_has_completed_onboarding.sql` in Supabase
3. Verify all columns are created successfully
4. Check indexes are in place

### Deployment Checklist
